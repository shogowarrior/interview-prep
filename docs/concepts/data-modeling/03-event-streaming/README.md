# Event Streaming

This section covers event-driven data models for streaming platforms, focusing on real-time data collection, experiment tracking, and performance monitoring.

## Files in this section

* **[A/B Testing Data Models](ab-testing-data-models.md)** - Experiment metadata, user assignments, and outcome measurement for recommendation algorithm tests
* **[Engagement Metrics](engagement-metrics.md)** - Daily Active Users (DAU), event tracking, and user engagement analysis by region
* **[Streaming Quality Metrics](streaming-quality-metrics.md)** - Playback quality monitoring, buffering analysis, and CDN performance tracking

## Key Design Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

* Append-only event storage for audit trails
* Time-based partitioning for efficient querying
* Clustering for related event grouping
* Real-time vs. batch processing trade-offs

### Experimentation Systems

* Consistent user assignment across sessions
* Statistical rigor with guardrails and CUPED
* Multi-variant testing with traffic allocation
* Model versioning and lineage tracking

### Quality of Service (QoS)

* Granular event collection for detailed analysis
* Rollup aggregations for performance dashboards
* Real-time alerting for service degradation
* Device and region-specific optimizations

## Common Interview Questions

* How would you design real-time DAU tracking at scale?
* What are the challenges of consistent experiment assignment?
* How do you balance event granularity with storage costs?
* How would you monitor streaming quality across global CDNs?

## Technical Considerations

* **Event Schema Evolution**: Handle changing event structures over time
* **Late Arriving Data**: Process events that arrive after their timestamp
* **Event Deduplication**: Handle duplicate events from client retries
* **Stream Processing**: Real-time aggregation vs. batch processing trade-offs
