# Event Streaming at Scale

## Overview

Designing scalable event streaming architecture to handle billions of streaming events daily while maintaining both queryability and performance.

## Ingestion Design

### Event Sources

* **Client applications**: Mobile, TV, web apps generating user interaction events
* **Content delivery**: CDN logs, streaming quality metrics, playback events
* **Backend services**: Recommendation requests, search queries, authentication events
* **Business systems**: Subscription changes, billing events, marketing interactions

### Streaming Platform

* **Apache Kafka** or **Amazon Kinesis** for event ingestion
* **Schema Registry** (Avro/Protobuf) for evolution and backward compatibility
* **Idempotent producers** with exactly-once semantics
* **Multi-region deployment** for global resilience

## Key Design Decisions

### Partitioning Strategy

```sql
-- Kafka topic partitioning
CREATE TOPIC playback_events WITH (
  partitions = 256,  -- Scale with throughput
  replication = 3     -- Cross-AZ resilience
);

-- Keys for affinity and ordering
Key strategies:
- session_id: Groups events from same playback session
- profile_id: Enables per-user analytics and recommendations
- Composite keys: (profile_id, event_type) for specialized processing
```

### Schema Evolution

* **Backward compatible**: New fields can be added without breaking existing consumers
* **Forward compatible**: Old consumers can read data written by new producers
* **Versioned schemas**: Track schema changes over time for debugging

## Bronze/Silver/Gold Architecture

### Bronze Layer (Raw)

* **Purpose**: Immutable raw data for compliance and reprocessing
* **Storage**: Delta Lake with minimal transformations
* **Partitioning**: By date (`dt = DATE(event_time)`) and ingestion time
* **Retention**: 7-90 days depending on data type

### Silver Layer (Cleaned)

* **Purpose**: Business-ready data with consistent schemas
* **Transformations**:
  * Type coercion and validation
  * Deduplication on natural keys
  * Dimension table joins (user, content, device metadata)
  * Data quality checks and quarantine
* **Optimization**: Z-Order clustering by common query dimensions

### Gold Layer (Aggregated)

* **Purpose**: Pre-computed metrics and business intelligence
* **Aggregations**:
  * Real-time dashboards (last 30 days)
  * Historical analytics (rolling windows)
  * ML feature stores (user behavior patterns)
  * Experiment results (A/B test outcomes)

## Storage Formats & Optimization

### File Formats

* **Delta Lake/Iceberg**: ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution
* **Parquet**: Columnar storage, compression, predicate pushdown
* **ZSTD/Snappy compression**: Balance between compression ratio and speed

### Performance Optimization

* **File sizing**: 128-512 MB optimal files for parallel processing
* **Compaction jobs**: Merge small files during off-peak hours
* **Metadata caching**: Speed up file discovery and planning

## Queryability Patterns

### Real-time Serving

* **Structured Streaming**: Continuous processing with Delta Live Tables
* **Materialized views**: Pre-computed aggregations for common queries
* **Caching layers**: Redis/Memcached for hot data paths

### Ad-hoc Analytics

* **Trino/Spark SQL**: Interactive querying across all layers
* **Clustering keys**: Optimize for common filter patterns
* **Partition pruning**: Date-based partitioning for time-series queries

## Scalability Challenges

### Hot Partition Management

* **VIP users**: Heavy users causing partition hotspots
* **Popular content**: Viral content generating disproportionate events
* **Regional events**: Country-specific content launches

### Mitigation Strategies

* **Key salting**: Add random prefix to distribute load across partitions
* **Dynamic partitioning**: Rebalance partitions based on load patterns
* **Multi-level partitioning**: Date + hash-based partitioning

## Monitoring & Observability

### Operational Metrics

* **Throughput**: Events per second, bytes per second
* **Latency**: End-to-end processing time, consumer lag
* **Error rates**: Failed events, schema validation errors

### Data Quality Metrics

* **Completeness**: Missing events, null rates
* **Accuracy**: Schema validation, business rule compliance
* **Freshness**: Data age, processing delays

## Streaming Platform Context

* **Global scale**: 200M+ subscribers generating billions of events daily
* **Multi-CDN architecture**: Events from multiple content delivery networks
* **Device diversity**: 1000+ device types with different event patterns
* **Content velocity**: New content launches generating massive event spikes
* **Real-time personalization**: Events must be processed quickly for recommendations

## Disaster Recovery

### Cross-Region Replication

* **Active-active**: Multiple regions serving traffic
* **Event replay**: Ability to reprocess historical events
* **Gradual catch-up**: New regions can catch up without downtime

### Data Consistency

* **Exactly-once processing**: Ensure no duplicate events in analytics
* **Idempotent operations**: Safe retry without side effects
* **Transaction boundaries**: Group related operations atomically

## Follow-up Considerations

* How would you design event streaming for global infrastructure?
* What are the trade-offs between different partitioning strategies?
* How do you ensure data quality at scale?
