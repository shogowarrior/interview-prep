# Scalability Patterns

This section covers advanced scalability patterns for handling massive data volumes, high throughput, and global distribution in streaming platforms.

## Files in this section

* **[Event Streaming at Scale](event-streaming-at-scale.md)** - Large-scale event streaming architecture, Bronze/Silver/Gold layers, and real-time processing patterns
* **[Partitioning & Sharding](partitioning-sharding.md)** - Data partitioning strategies, sharding techniques, and hot key management for distributed systems

## Key Design Patterns

### Large-Scale Event Processing

* Bronze/Silver/Gold data lake architecture
* Schema evolution and backward compatibility
* Cross-region replication and disaster recovery
* Real-time vs. batch processing trade-offs

### Data Distribution Strategies

* Date-based and composite partitioning
* Consistent hashing for sharding
* Hot key management and load balancing
* Multi-tier storage (hot/warm/cold)

### Performance Optimization

* File sizing and compaction strategies
* Metadata caching and query optimization
* Partition pruning and clustering
* Storage format selection (Delta, Parquet, etc.)

## Common Interview Questions

* How would you design a data lake to handle billions of events daily?
* What are the trade-offs between different partitioning strategies?
* How do you handle hot partitions and data skew?
* How would you migrate a large dataset without downtime?

## Technical Considerations

* **Storage Formats**: Delta Lake/Iceberg for ACID transactions and time travel
* **Compression**: ZSTD/Snappy for balancing compression ratio and speed
* **File Sizing**: 128-512 MB optimal files for parallel processing
* **Query Engines**: Trino/Spark for interactive analytics, streaming for real-time

## Monitoring & Operations

* **Operational Metrics**: Throughput, latency, error rates, data quality
* **Maintenance Tasks**: Rebalancing, compaction, retention policies
* **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region replication, event replay capabilities
* **Cost Optimization**: Lifecycle management and storage tiering
