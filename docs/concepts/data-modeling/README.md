## 🎯 Key Design Principles

### Data Architecture Patterns

* **Bronze/Silver/Gold Layers**: Raw → Cleaned → Business-ready data
* **Event-Driven Design**: Immutable events with derived state
* **Multi-Tenant Awareness**: Account-level isolation and resource management
* **Global Scale**: Cross-region distribution and disaster recovery

### Performance Optimization

* **Partitioning Strategies**: Date-based, hash-based, and composite partitioning
* **Indexing Patterns**: Composite indexes and clustering for query optimization
* **Storage Tiers**: Hot/warm/cold storage with lifecycle management
* **Caching Layers**: Real-time serving with Redis/Memcached integration

### Data Quality & Governance

* **Schema Evolution**: Backward/forward compatibility with Avro/Protobuf
* **Data Validation**: Constraints, business rules, and quality monitoring
* **Audit Trails**: Immutable event logs and change data capture
* **Compliance**: PII separation, retention policies, and data sovereignty

## 📋 Common Interview Questions

### Core Data Modeling

* How would you model a content catalog that supports multiple languages and regions?
* What are the trade-offs between normalized and denormalized approaches?
* How do you handle many-to-many relationships in a distributed system?
* How would you design for efficient 'continue watching' functionality?

### Scalability & Performance

* How do you choose partitioning keys for time-series data?
* What strategies do you use to handle hot partitions and data skew?
* How would you design a real-time DAU dashboard at massive scale?
* What are the trade-offs between different storage formats (Delta, Parquet, etc.)?

### Real-Time & Event Streaming

* How do you ensure consistent user assignment in A/B testing?
* What are the challenges of event schema evolution at scale?
