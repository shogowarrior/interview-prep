3. **Tackle Advanced problems** to understand complex patterns
4. **Challenge yourself with Expert problems** focusing on optimization

Each problem includes:

- Clear problem statement
- Sample data schema
- Expected output format
- Solution with detailed explanations
- Performance considerations

## Contributing

To add new problems:

1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate subdirectory
