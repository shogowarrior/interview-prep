## Beginner Level Basic Analytics

Exercises focusing on fundamental SQL operations including aggregation, grouping, and basic data manipulation.

### 1. Daily Active Users (DAU)

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Understand basic aggregation with `COUNT DISTINCT`
- Practice `GROUP BY` with date-based grouping
- Learn to calculate user metrics per time period

**Question:**  
You have a table `user_activity`:

| user_id | activity_date | activity_type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 101     | 2025-08-01    | play          |
| 101     | 2025-08-01    | pause         |
| 102     | 2025-08-01    | play          |
| 103     | 2025-08-02    | play          |

Write a query to find the number of **unique active users per day**.

**Solution:**:

```sql
SELECT
  activity_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS daily_active_users
FROM user_activity
GROUP BY activity_date
ORDER BY activity_date;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Groups by day and counts distinct users
- Basic aggregation pattern for DAU calculation
- Common Netflix interview question for analytics basics

- [Aggregate Functions](../aggregation/aggregate-functions.md)
- [SQL Concepts Overview](../README.md#core-sql-fundamentals)

### 2. Day-1 Retention

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Practice self-joins with date arithmetic
- Calculate retention metrics using percentages
- Understand cohort analysis patterns

**Question:**  
From `user_signup(user_id, signup_date)` and `user_activity(user_id, activity_date)`, calculate **Day-1 retention** (users who signed up on Day X and came back on Day X+1).

**Solution:**:

```sql
SELECT
  s.signup_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT s.user_id) AS day1_retention
FROM user_signup s
LEFT JOIN user_activity a
  ON s.user_id = a.user_id
  AND a.activity_date = DATE_ADD(s.signup_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY s.signup_date;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Numerator: users active next day after signup
- Denominator: total signups for that day
- Uses `LEFT JOIN` with date filtering for the retention logic
- Common cohort analysis pattern in user analytics

**Cross-references:**:

- [JOINs and Relationships](../joins/README.md)
- [Aggregate Functions](../aggregation/aggregate-functions.md)

### 3. Most Watched Show per Day

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Implement ranking without window functions
- Practice subqueries for top-N queries
- Understand content analytics patterns

**Question:**  
Table `watch_history`:

| user_id | show_id | watch_date | watch_time_minutes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| 1       | A       | 2025-08-01 | 30                |
| 2       | A       | 2025-08-01 | 50                |
| 3       | B       | 2025-08-01 | 80                |

Find the **most watched show per day** (based on total minutes).

**Solution:**:

```sql
SELECT watch_date, show_id
FROM (
  SELECT
    watch_date,
    show_id,
    SUM(watch_time_minutes) AS total_watch_time,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY watch_date ORDER BY SUM(watch_time_minutes) DESC) AS rnk
  FROM watch_history
  GROUP BY watch_date, show_id
) t
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Uses window function `RANK()` to find the top show per day
- Groups by date and show first, then ranks within each date
- Basic ranking pattern for top-N per category problems

**Cross-references:**:

- [Window Functions](../window-functions/README.md)
- [Aggregate Functions](../aggregation/aggregate-functions.md)

## Intermediate Level Window Functions & Ranking

Exercises focusing on advanced analytics using window functions, ranking, and navigation functions.

### 4. Top 3 Shows per Region

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Master `DENSE_RANK()` vs `RANK()` functions
- Practice partitioning for grouped rankings
- Understand regional analytics patterns

**Question:**  
Table `viewership(user_id, show_id, region, watch_time)`.  
Find the **top 3 most watched shows per region** by total minutes.

**Solution:**:

```sql
SELECT region, show_id, total_watch_time
FROM (
  SELECT
    region,
    show_id,
    SUM(watch_time) AS total_watch_time,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(watch_time) DESC) AS rnk
  FROM viewership
  GROUP BY region, show_id
) t
WHERE rnk <= 3;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Uses `DENSE_RANK()` for ranking within each region
- `DENSE_RANK()` vs `RANK()`: no gaps in ranking (1,2,2,3 vs 1,2,2,4)
- Groups by region and show first, then applies ranking window function
- Common pattern for "top N per category" problems

**Cross-references:**:

- [Ranking Functions](../window-functions/postgresql-ranking-functions.md)
- [Window Functions Overview](../window-functions/window-functions-overview.md)

### 5. Consecutive Days Watching

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Use navigation functions (`LAG`/`LEAD`) for pattern detection
- Implement streak analysis with window functions
- Practice date arithmetic for consecutive patterns

**Question:**  
From `user_activity(user_id, activity_date)`, find users who have watched content for **3 consecutive days**.

**Solution:**:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    activity_date,
    LAG(activity_date,1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY activity_date) AS prev_day,
    LAG(activity_date,2) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY activity_date) AS prev2_day
  FROM user_activity
) t
WHERE DATEDIFF(activity_date, prev_day) = 1
  AND DATEDIFF(prev_day, prev2_day) = 1;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Uses `LAG()` window function to look back at previous activity dates
- `DATEDIFF()` checks for consecutive days (difference = 1)
- Alternative approach: use `ROW_NUMBER()` and date arithmetic for more complex streak detection
- Common pattern for "consecutive days" or "streak" problems

## Advanced Level Complex Patterns & Optimization

Exercises covering advanced SQL patterns including CTEs, recursive queries, and performance optimization techniques.

### 6. Heavy Watchers Retention (CTEs)

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Build multi-step analysis using CTEs
- Implement complex retention calculations
- Practice CTE chaining for readability

**Question:**  
Find users who watched >100 minutes in a day, and then find how many of them watched again the next day.

**Solution:**:

```sql
WITH daily_watch AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE(event_ts) AS watch_date,
    SUM(watch_time) AS total_minutes
  FROM watch_events
  GROUP BY user_id, DATE(event_ts)
),
heavy_watchers AS (
  SELECT user_id, watch_date
  FROM daily_watch
  WHERE total_minutes > 100
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT h1.user_id) AS retained_users
FROM heavy_watchers h1
JOIN heavy_watchers h2
  ON h1.user_id = h2.user_id
  AND h2.watch_date = DATE_ADD(h1.watch_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY);
```

**Explanation:**:

- Uses CTEs to break down the problem into logical steps
- First CTE calculates daily watch time per user
- Second CTE identifies heavy watchers
- Final query joins to find retention
- CTEs improve readability and allow step-by-step problem solving

- [CTE vs Window Functions](../cte/cte-vs-window-comparison.md)

### 7. Content Hierarchy (Recursive CTEs)

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Implement recursive CTEs for hierarchical data
- Understand tree-like data structures in SQL
- Practice path generation and level calculation

**Question:**  
Model content hierarchy (seasons, episodes) using recursive CTEs.

**Solution:**:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE content_hierarchy AS (
  -- Base case: top-level content
  SELECT
    content_id,
    parent_id,
    title,
    0 AS level,
    CAST(content_id AS VARCHAR) AS path
  FROM content
  WHERE parent_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive case: child content
  SELECT
    c.content_id,
    c.parent_id,
    c.title,
    ch.level + 1,
    CONCAT(ch.path, '>', c.content_id)
  FROM content c
  JOIN content_hierarchy ch ON c.parent_id = ch.content_id
)
SELECT * FROM content_hierarchy ORDER BY path;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Recursive CTE handles hierarchical or tree-like data structures
- Base case starts with root content (no parent)
- Recursive case builds the hierarchy level by level
- Generates path and level information for each item

### 8. Percentile Analysis (Advanced Window Functions)

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Use statistical window functions like `PERCENT_RANK()`
- Implement percentile-based user segmentation
- Practice advanced ranking techniques

**Question:**
Find the top 1% of users by total watch time.

**Solution:**:

```sql
WITH user_totals AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    SUM(watch_time) AS total_watch_time
  FROM watch_events
  GROUP BY user_id
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    total_watch_time,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_watch_time DESC) AS pct_rank
  FROM user_totals
)
SELECT user_id, total_watch_time
FROM ranked
WHERE pct_rank <= 0.01;
```

**Explanation:**:

- `PERCENT_RANK()` enables statistical analysis
- Identifies top percentage of users by any metric
- Useful for user segmentation and targeting

### 9. Query Performance Optimization

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Optimize queries for large datasets
- Use approximate functions for performance
- Implement date range filtering effectively

**Question:**  
Optimizing daily active users query for large datasets.

**Solution:**:

```sql
-- Optimized version with proper partitioning
SELECT
  DATE(event_ts) AS activity_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS daily_active_users
FROM watch_events
WHERE event_ts >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY  -- Limit date range
  AND event_ts < CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY DATE(event_ts)
ORDER BY activity_date;

-- Alternative using approximate counting for very large datasets
SELECT
  DATE(event_ts) AS activity_date,
  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id) AS approx_dau
FROM watch_events
WHERE event_ts >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY DATE(event_ts);
```

**Explanation:**:

- Date range filtering reduces data scanned
- `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT()` trades accuracy for performance
- Partitioning by date enables efficient queries

### 10. Indexing Strategy

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Design composite indexes for query patterns
- Understand covering indexes vs regular indexes
- Implement partial indexes for filtered data

**Question:**

Key indexes for common Netflix query patterns.

**Solution:**:

```sql
-- Composite index for user activity queries
CREATE INDEX idx_user_date ON watch_events (user_id, event_ts);

-- Covering index for content analytics
CREATE INDEX idx_content_metrics ON watch_events (show_id, event_ts, watch_time);

-- Partial index for active users only
CREATE INDEX idx_recent_activity ON watch_events (user_id, event_ts)
WHERE event_ts >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90' DAY;
```

**Explanation:**:

- Composite indexes optimize multi-column queries
- Covering indexes avoid table lookups
- Partial indexes reduce index size for filtered data
