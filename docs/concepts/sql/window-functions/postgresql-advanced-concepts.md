# PostgreSQL Advanced Window Functions - Complete Guide

## 🔹 Overview

This guide covers advanced PostgreSQL window function concepts including frame specifications, named windows, performance optimization, and complex analytical patterns.

## 🖼️ Window Frame Specifications

### Understanding Window Frames

Window frames define which rows are included in the calculation for each row. PostgreSQL supports three frame types:

#### ROWS - Physical Row-Based Frames

```sql
ROWS frame_extent
```

**Frame Extents:**:

- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` - All rows from partition start to current row
- `n PRECEDING` - n rows before current row
- `CURRENT ROW` - Current row only
- `n FOLLOWING` - n rows after current row
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` - All rows from current row to partition end

**Examples:**:

```sql
-- Last 3 rows including current
ROWS 2 PRECEDING

-- Current row and next 2
ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 2 FOLLOWING

-- All rows from start to end (complete partition)
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
```

#### RANGE - Logical Value-Based Frames

```sql
RANGE frame_extent
```

**Frame Extents (with ORDER BY required):**:

- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` - All rows with values <= current row's value
- `n PRECEDING` - Rows with values in range [current - n, current]
- `CURRENT ROW` - Rows with same value as current row
- `n FOLLOWING` - Rows with values in range [current, current + n]
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` - All rows with values >= current row's value

**Examples:**:

```sql
-- All rows with same or smaller ORDER BY value
RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING

-- Rows within 5 units of current value
RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING
```

#### GROUPS - Group-Based Frames

```sql
GROUPS frame_extent
```

**Frame Extents:**:

- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` - All peer groups from start to current
- `n PRECEDING` - n peer groups before current group
- `CURRENT ROW` - Current peer group
- `n FOLLOWING` - n peer groups after current group
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` - All peer groups from current to end

### Default Frame Behavior

When no frame is specified:

- **With ORDER BY**: `RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`
- **Without ORDER BY**: `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`

## 🏷️ Named Window Specifications

### Basic Named Windows

Use the `WINDOW` clause to define reusable window specifications:

```sql
SELECT
    col1,
    col2,
    function1() OVER my_window,
    function2() OVER my_window
FROM table1
WINDOW my_window AS (PARTITION BY col1 ORDER BY col2);
```

### Advanced Named Window Techniques

#### Window Inheritance

```sql
SELECT
    col1, col2, col3,
    SUM(col3) OVER base_window,
    AVG(col3) OVER (base_window ROWS 2 PRECEDING),
    MAX(col3) OVER (base_window ORDER BY col1)
FROM table1
WINDOW base_window AS (PARTITION BY col1 ORDER BY col2);
```

#### Complex Window Combinations

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department,
    salary,
    hire_date,

    -- Department ranking
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER dept_window AS dept_rank,

    -- Department salary percentile
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER dept_window AS dept_percentile,

    -- Company-wide ranking
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER company_window AS company_rank,

    -- Moving average in department
    AVG(salary) OVER (dept_window ROWS 2 PRECEDING) AS dept_moving_avg,

    -- Cumulative salary by hire date
    SUM(salary) OVER (hire_window ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS cumulative_salary

FROM employees
WINDOW
    dept_window AS (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC),
    company_window AS (ORDER BY salary DESC),
    hire_window AS (ORDER BY hire_date);
```

### Example 3 Customer Behavior Analysis

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_events (
    customer_id INT,
    event_date DATE,
    event_type VARCHAR(20),
    event_value DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Advanced customer analytics
WITH customer_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        event_date,
        event_type,
        event_value,

        -- Days since first event
        event_date - MIN(event_date) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
        ) AS days_since_first_event,

        -- Days since previous event
        event_date - LAG(event_date) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY event_date
        ) AS days_since_prev_event,

        -- Event sequence number
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY event_date
        ) AS event_sequence,

        -- Cumulative value by customer
        SUM(event_value) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY event_date
            ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
        ) AS cumulative_value,

        -- Rolling 30-day activity
        COUNT(*) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY event_date
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '30 days' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS activity_30d,

        -- Customer lifetime value percentile
        PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
            ORDER BY SUM(event_value) OVER (
                PARTITION BY customer_id
                ORDER BY event_date
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
            )

    event_sequence,
    cumulative_value,
    activity_30d,
    lifetime_value_percentile,

    -- Customer segment based on activity
    CASE
        WHEN activity_30d >= 10 THEN 'High Activity'
        WHEN activity_30d >= 5 THEN 'Medium Activity'
        ELSE 'Low Activity'
    END AS activity_segment,

    -- Value segment based on percentile
    CASE
        WHEN lifetime_value_percentile >= 0.8 THEN 'Top 20%'
        WHEN lifetime_value_percentile >= 0.6 THEN '60-80%'

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Index Strategy for Window Functions

#### Optimal Indexing Patterns

```sql
-- For PARTITION BY + ORDER BY
CREATE INDEX idx_table_partition_order ON table_name (partition_col, order_col);

-- For time-based windows
CREATE INDEX idx_table_time ON table_name (partition_col, timestamp_col);

-- For range frames
CREATE INDEX idx_table_range ON table_name (partition_col, numeric_col);
```

### Performance Best Practices

1. **Choose Appropriate Frame Types**:
   - Use `ROWS` for physical row navigation
   - Use `RANGE` for value-based calculations
   - Use `GROUPS` for peer group analysis

2. **Minimize Frame Size**:
   - Explicit frames perform better than defaults
   - Smaller frames use less memory and CPU

3. **Partition Strategy**:
   - Smaller partitions = better performance
   - Consider partition pruning with proper indexes

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Monitor work_mem for large result sets
   - Consider temp_file_limit for disk spilling

### PostgreSQL-Specific Optimizations

```sql
-- Enable parallel processing (if beneficial)
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;

-- Monitor window function performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT
    id,
    SUM(value) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
FROM large_table;

-- Use appropriate work memory
SET work_mem = '256MB';
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1 Unexpected Results with Default Frames

```sql
-- Problem: LAST_VALUE returns wrong result
SELECT id, value, LAST_VALUE(value) OVER (ORDER BY id) FROM table1;

-- Solution: Specify explicit frame
SELECT id, value, LAST_VALUE(value) OVER (
    ORDER BY id
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
) FROM table1;
```

### Issue 2 Performance Degradation

```sql
-- Problem: Slow query with large partitions
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY large_partition ORDER BY col) rn
    FROM huge_table
) t WHERE rn <= 10;

-- Solution: Filter before window function
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY col) rn
    FROM (SELECT * FROM huge_table WHERE large_partition = 'target' LIMIT 1000) t
) t WHERE rn <= 10;
```

### Issue 3 Memory Issues

```sql
-- Problem: Out of memory with large frames
SELECT id, SUM(value) OVER (ORDER BY date) FROM large_table;

-- Solution: Use smaller frames or increase work_mem
SET work_mem = '1GB';
SELECT id, SUM(value) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS 1000 PRECEDING
) FROM large_table;
```

## 🎯 Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1 Complex Aggregations

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    subcategory,
    value,
    -- Category total
    SUM(value) OVER (category_window) AS category_total,
    -- Category average
    AVG(value) OVER (category_window) AS category_avg,
    -- Category rank
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (category_window) AS category_rank,
    -- Subcategory contribution to category
    ROUND(value / SUM(value) OVER (category_window) * 100, 2) AS category_contribution_pct,
    -- Global rank within category
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY value DESC) AS global_rank
FROM data_table
WINDOW category_window AS (PARTITION BY category);
```

### Pattern 2 Time Series with Gaps

```sql
SELECT
    date,
    value,
    -- Fill gaps using last known value
    COALESCE(
        value,
        LAST_VALUE(value) IGNORE NULLS OVER (
            ORDER BY date
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
        )
    ) AS filled_value,
    -- Moving average excluding NULLs
    AVG(value) IGNORE NULLS OVER (
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS 6 PRECEDING
    ) AS moving_avg_ignore_nulls
FROM time_series;
```

### Pattern 3 Sessionization

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    event_time,
    event_type,
    -- Session ID based on 30-minute gaps
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
            event_time - LAG(event_time) OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time
            )
        )) / 60 > 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    ) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time) AS session_id,
    -- Events in current session
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY event_time
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) - COALESCE(
        SUM(
            CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
                event_time - LAG(event_time) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time
                )
            )) / 60 > 30 THEN COUNT(*) OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_id
                ORDER BY event_time
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            ) END
        ) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time), 0
    ) AS session_event_count
FROM user_events;
```
