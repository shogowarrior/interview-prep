# CTE vs Window Functions: Performance and Readability Comparison

## Introduction

Both of your CTE-based SQL queries are **correct** and will return the **same result** — customers whose total sales are greater than the average of all customer totals.

But they differ in **style**, **performance**, and **readability**.

---

## ✅ Option 1 — Using two CTEs with scalar subquery logic

```sql
WITH customer_totals AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
average_total AS (
    SELECT AVG(total_sales) AS avg_sales
    FROM customer_totals
)
SELECT ct.*
FROM customer_totals ct, average_total at
WHERE ct.total_sales > at.avg_sales;
```

***🔍 Pros***

* Very **clear and modular**: one CTE for totals, one for the average.
* Easy to understand in steps.
* Works well on **most SQL engines**, even older ones.

***🧠 How it works***

* Step 1: Compute `customer_id → total_sales`.
* Step 2: Compute a **single row** with average.
* Step 3: Join both (effectively applying the average as a filter).

***⚠️ Caveat***

* The second CTE (`average_total`) is a **scalar subquery** — computed once.
* In large datasets, the **optimizer** will usually inline it, but not always efficiently.

---

## ✅ Option 2 — Using window function

```sql
WITH customer_totals AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         SUM(amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY customer_id
),
with_avg AS (
  SELECT *,
         AVG(total_sales) OVER () AS avg_sales
  FROM customer_totals
)
SELECT customer_id, total_sales
FROM with_avg
WHERE total_sales > avg_sales;
```

***🔍 Pros***

* Uses **window function** to calculate the average **inline**, over all rows.
* **No joins** — simpler physical query plan.
* Very efficient for large datasets and modern engines (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

***🧠 How it works**

* `AVG(total_sales) OVER ()` computes a rolling (same) average across all rows.
* Each row gets that value, and we filter with `WHERE`.

***⚠️ Caveat***

* Slightly **harder to read** if you're not familiar with window functions.
* May not be supported in older SQL engines (e.g., MySQL 5.x).

## ✅ Verdict

| Feature                 | Option 1 (CTE + scalar avg)    | Option 2 (window avg)               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Simplicity (conceptual) | ✅ Easier for beginners         | Slightly more advanced              |
| Performance (modern DB) | ⚠️ Good, but depends on engine | ✅ Usually faster, no join           |
| Readability             | ✅ Very readable                | ✅ Clean, but needs window knowledge |
| Portability             | ✅ More widely supported        | ⚠️ Some older DBs lack `OVER`       |

### 👉 Recommendation

* Use **Option 2** if your DB engine supports window functions — it's efficient and clean.
* Use **Option 1** if you're targeting compatibility or working with developers new to SQL.

### 🚀 PostgreSQL-Specific Enhancements

For PostgreSQL users, Option 2 can be further optimized using **named windows** and **advanced frame specifications**:

```sql
WITH customer_totals AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        department,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
        COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id, department
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    department,
    total_sales,
    order_count,
    -- Multiple window functions with named windows
    overall_avg_sales,
    dept_avg_sales,
    ROUND((total_sales - overall_avg_sales) / overall_avg_sales * 100, 2) AS vs_global_avg_pct,
    ROUND((total_sales - dept_avg_sales) / dept_avg_sales * 100, 2) AS vs_dept_avg_pct,
    -- Performance metrics
    sales_rank,
    performance_percentile
FROM (
    SELECT *,
        -- Named windows for PostgreSQL optimization
        AVG(total_sales) OVER global_window AS overall_avg_sales,
        AVG(total_sales) OVER dept_window AS dept_avg_sales,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER global_window AS sales_rank,
        ROUND(PERCENT_RANK() OVER global_window * 100, 1) AS performance_percentile
    FROM customer_totals
    WINDOW
        global_window AS (),
        dept_window AS (PARTITION BY department)
) analysis
WHERE total_sales > overall_avg_sales
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

**PostgreSQL Advantages:**:

* **Named Windows**: Avoid repetition and improve readability
* **Performance**: Optimized execution plans for window functions
* **Advanced Functions**: Access to PostgreSQL-specific window functions
* **Memory Efficiency**: Better memory management for large datasets

### 📊 Performance Comparison (PostgreSQL)

| Metric | CTE + Scalar Subquery | Window Function | Named Windows |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Query Complexity | Medium | Low | Low |
| Memory Usage | Higher | Optimized | Optimized |
| Execution Time | Variable | Usually faster | Fastest |
| Readability | High | Medium-High | High |
| PostgreSQL Optimization | Good | Excellent | Excellent |

### 💡 PostgreSQL Performance Tips

1. **Index Strategy**: Create indexes on `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` columns
2. **Named Windows**: Use for queries with multiple window functions
3. **Frame Control**: Be explicit about frames to optimize memory usage
4. **Parallel Processing**: PostgreSQL can parallelize window functions
5. **Memory Settings**: Adjust `work_mem` for large result sets
