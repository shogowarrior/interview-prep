# Interview Concepts

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for interview preparation, focusing on core technical concepts essential for data engineering, system design, and software development roles. It provides structured learning paths, practical examples, and real-world applications to help candidates master key areas through progressive skill development.

## Key Areas

### [Concepts](concepts/README.md)

The concepts directory offers structured guidance across three main technical domains:

- [**SQL**](concepts/sql/README.md): Database querying, analytics, and performance optimization
- [**Data Modeling**](concepts/data-modeling/README.md): Database design patterns and architectural principles
- [**System Design**](concepts/system-design/README.md): Scalable system architecture and design patterns

Each area includes progressive learning paths from fundamentals to advanced techniques, with practical exercises and real-world case studies.

### [Interviews](interviews/README.md)

The interviews directory contains company-specific interview problems and case studies, featuring challenges from organizations such as Netflix, Anthropic, and others. These materials provide targeted preparation for industry-specific technical interviews.
