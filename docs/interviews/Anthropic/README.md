# Anthropic Interview Questions

## From anthropic-chatgpt.md

This file contains a comprehensive interview prep sheet with 8 coding and design problems covering system design, algorithms, and AI ethics.

- **[Stack Trace Reconstruction](anthropic-chatgpt.md#stack-trace-reconstruction)**: Reconstruct valid stack traces from function call lists, handling mismatches and malformed sequences.
- **[Sorting & Data Mutation Challenges](anthropic-chatgpt.md#sorting--data-mutation-challenges)**: Implement sorting algorithms with data mutations, focusing on performance, stability, and edge cases.
- **[Web Crawler (Concurrency & Async Evolution)](anthropic-chatgpt.md#web-crawler-concurrency--async-evolution)**: Build a web crawler evolving from synchronous to asynchronous with concurrency, including rate limiting and fault tolerance.
- **[GPT / Claude Multi-Threaded Chat System](anthropic-chatgpt.md#gpt--claude-multi-threaded-chat-system)**: Design a system for handling multiple user questions in a single chat thread, managing state and concurrency.
- **[File System / In-Memory File Store](anthropic-chatgpt.md#file-system--in-memory-file-store)**: Design an in-memory data store with CRUD operations, backup/restore, and querying capabilities.
- **[Multi-Tiered Banking System](anthropic-chatgpt.md#multi-tiered-banking-system)**: Build a banking system with transaction processing, analytics, scheduled transactions, and account merging.
- **[In-Memory CRUD / OOP Systems](anthropic-chatgpt.md#in-memory-crud--oop-systems)**: Implement in-memory CRUD for applications like employee timesheets, handling data validation and constraints.
- **[Open-Ended Ethics AI Emotion](anthropic-chatgpt.md#open-ended-ethics-ai-emotion)**: Discuss ethical implications if AI develops emotions, exploring anthropomorphism and societal impacts.
