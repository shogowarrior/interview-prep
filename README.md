# Interview Preparation Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of resources for interview preparation in software engineering. It consolidates practice problems, conceptual explanations, and practical examples across multiple domains to help developers prepare for technical interviews.

## Contents

- **Coding Problems**: Solutions and explanations for common algorithmic challenges in multiple programming languages (Python, Java, etc.)
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of fundamental algorithms including data structures like stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and more
- **System Design**: Examples and patterns for designing scalable systems, including banking systems, distributed file systems, and web crawlers
- **SQL Concepts**: Comprehensive coverage of SQL fundamentals including joins, queries, optimization techniques, window functions, and advanced patterns

## Directory Structure

### `src/` - Implementation Code

Contains working code examples and solutions:

- **Python**: Array/string problems, graph algorithms (BFS/DFS), hash maps, heaps, recursion, trees, and sorting
- **Java**: System design implementations including banking applications, file systems, and web crawlers

### `docs/` - Theoretical Content

Documentation and conceptual explanations:

- **System Design**: Architectural patterns and design principles
- **SQL Topics**: Advanced queries, aggregation, CTEs, joins, optimization, and interview problems
- **Data Modeling**: Entity relationships, scalability patterns, and event streaming
- **Interview Experiences**: Real interview problems and solutions from companies like Anthropic, Netflix, Nextdoor, and Okareo

## Getting Started

Explore the directories based on your focus area:

1. **For Coding Practice**: Start with `src/python/` or `src/main/java/` for hands-on problem solving
2. **For Theory**: Refer to `docs/` for in-depth explanations and concepts
3. **For Company-Specific Prep**: Check `docs/interviews/` for real interview examples
4. **For Database Skills**: Dive into `docs/concepts/SQL/` and related SQL problems

Each directory contains README files with detailed explanations and navigation guides.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute additional problems, solutions, or documentation. Please ensure code is well-commented and follows the existing structure.

## Resources

This repository is designed to be a one-stop resource for interview preparation. Regular updates include new problems, improved solutions, and additional theoretical content to keep pace with evolving interview patterns
