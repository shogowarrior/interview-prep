### Okareo Interview Solution

# A six-sided dice is thrown repeatedly with results recorded as int[]. 
# Each time we can only see three sides - top, front, right (bottom, left, back are hidden). 

# The visible sides are recorded in the order top, front, right. So for example [1,2,3] is top = 1, front = 2, and right = 3. Each side could be a number 1 to 50.

# Multiple throws are recorded as [ [1,2,3], [1,3,6], [1,25,45]...]

# We need to check that these historical throws data is consistent with respect to a single six-sided dice. 

# Write a method consistent(throws list[list[int]]) ‚Üí int. 
# The method returns 1 based index of the first entry in throws history that is inconsistent with respect to previous ones. If all the historical data is consistent the method should return 0.

# Examples / Test Cases (PLEASE see next page)

#[[1,2,3], [26,3,2]] Returns 0

# First throw 26 is on the bottom, second throw 26 is on top.


# [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [2,3,1], [7,8,9]]  Returns 4

# [7,8,9] can‚Äôt happen because that would be more than 6 different labels


# [[1,2,1], [3,4,5]] Returns 1

# First throw two sides are labeled as 1.
